# Description

In this folder there are various scripts for post processing of the range azimuth map taken from the AWR1843 board. 

After acquiring the map directly from the memory as hexadecimal values in a file it can be processed by the main script 'radarAzMap.sh'. Right now the script is used to create the maps we needed, by changing the input and output filepath it can be customized.
